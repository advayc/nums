nums is an open-source hit counter and badge service for your website. It provides fast, serverless tracking using **Go** and **Redis**.

What you can do
- Increment counts with `/hit?id=...` (auth required)
- Read counts as JSON (`/count`) or text (`/count.txt`)
- Display badges that update automatically (`/badge`, `/badge.json`)

Default base URL (demo): `https://nums.advay.ca/`

Security note: Only `/hit` requires a secret. All read endpoints are public by design.
