## Shields.io (recommended for GitHub)

Shields.io badges are a reliable and consistent way to display dynamic data, such as hit counters, on platforms like GitHub. Below is an example of how to use a Shields.io badge:

```markdown
![hits](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnums.advay.ca%2Fbadge.json%3Fid%3Dhome%26label%3Dhits%26cacheSeconds%3D30)
```

### Key Features
- **Caching**: Updates approximately every 30 seconds due to Shields.io's caching mechanism.
- **Reliability**: Works seamlessly across GitHub, npm, and other platforms.
- **Consistency**: Ideal for projects requiring stable and predictable badge behavior.

### How to Use
1. Copy the Markdown snippet above.
2. Replace `id=home` with your unique counter ID.
3. Paste it into your README.md or any Markdown-supported file.

## Direct SVG (live from nums)

Direct SVG badges fetch live data directly from your nums server. This method offers more customization options and faster updates. Here's an example:

```markdown
![hits](https://nums.advay.ca/badge?id=home&style=terminal&label=hits&bg=08c4fc&labelColor=000000&valueColor=ffffff&font=monospace)
```

### Key Features
- **Instant Updates**: Reflects real-time data from your server.
- **Customizable**: Modify the badge's appearance to match your project's theme.
- **GitHub Caching**: Note that GitHub may cache the image for 1–2 minutes.

### Customization Parameters
Below is a table of parameters you can use to customize your badge:

| Param        | Example            | Description                                      |

| `cache`      | `30`               | Cache time in seconds (optional override)        |

### How to Use

2. Replace `id=home` with your unique counter ID.
3. Adjust the parameters to customize the badge's appearance.

## Plaintext Badge

Plaintext badges are a simple and lightweight option for displaying hit counters in plain text format. These badges are ideal for environments where images are not supported or when you prefer a minimalistic approach.

### Example

```link
https://<YOUR_DEPLOYMENT_URL>/count.txt
```

### Key Features
- **Lightweight**: No images, just plain text.
- **Universal Compatibility**: Works in any environment that supports text.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Fetches the latest counter value directly from the server.

### How to Use
1. Copy the plaintext URL above.
2. Replace `id=home` with your unique counter ID.
3. Paste the URL into your desired location (e.g., README.md, plain text file, etc.).
4. When accessed, the URL will display the current counter value as plain text.

### Use Cases
- **CLI Tools**: Display hit counters in terminal-based applications.
- **Text-Only Platforms**: Ideal for environments that do not support images.
- **Minimalistic Projects**: Perfect for projects that prioritize simplicity and speed.
