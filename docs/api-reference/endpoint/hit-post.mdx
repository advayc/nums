openapi: 'POST /hit'

Increment the counter for an id and return the updated value.

Authentication
- Send your secret via `X-Auth-Token` header or `?token=` query.

Before you test
- Use your own deployment URL (e.g., `https://<project>.vercel.app`) and your secret token from the server env (`SECRET_TOKEN`).
- The public instance at `https://nums.advay.ca` is read-friendly; incrementing requires your own secret.

Example (self-hosted)
```bash
curl -H "X-Auth-Token: $SECRET_TOKEN" "https://<project>.vercel.app/hit?id=home"
```

Tip
- Viewing counts does not require any token. See `/count` and `/count.txt`.
