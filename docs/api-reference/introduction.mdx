Welcome to the nums API. Increment, read, and display counters as JSON, text, or badges.

## Base URL
- Hosted instance: `https://nums.advay.ca/`
- Self-host: `https://<project>.vercel.app`

## Authentication
- Only `/hit` requires your secret. Send as `X-Auth-Token` header or `?token=` query.
- Read endpoints (`/count`, `/count.txt`, `/badge`, `/badge.json`) are public.

## Environment
- `SECRET_TOKEN` — required for write access to `/hit`
- `UPSTASH_REDIS_URL` and `UPSTASH_REDIS_PASSWORD` — recommended for persistence (or set `REDIS_URL`)

## Quick examples
<CodeGroup>
```bash Increment
curl -H "X-Auth-Token: $SECRET_TOKEN" "https://nums.advay.ca/hit?id=home"
```

```bash Read JSON
curl "https://nums.advay.ca/count?id=home"
```

```bash Read text
curl "https://nums.advay.ca/count.txt?id=home"
```
</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
Use your own deployment for POST /hit tests that require your secret.
