Welcome to the nums API. This service lets you increment, read, and display view counters.

Base URL
Default public instance: `https://nums.advay.ca/`.
Or use your own Vercel deployment, e.g. `https://<project>.vercel.app`.

Authentication
- Only the /hit endpoint requires a secret. Send it as the `X-Auth-Token` header or `?token=` query.
- All read endpoints are public.

Environment variables
- SECRET_TOKEN: required for /hit
- UPSTASH_REDIS_URL and UPSTASH_REDIS_PASSWORD: for Redis persistence (or provide REDIS_URL)

Quick example
```
curl -H "X-Auth-Token: $SECRET_TOKEN" "https://nums.advay.ca/hit?id=home"   # requires your secret if you self-host
curl "https://nums.advay.ca/count?id=home"
```

Note: For POST requests to `/hit`, try it with your own deployment and secret token.

Testing guidance
- Incrementing (`/hit`): requires your own deployment (e.g., Vercel) and your `SECRET_TOKEN`.
- Reading (`/count`, `/count.txt`, badges): public; can use the default instance or your own.
