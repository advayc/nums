nums is an open-source hit counter and badge service. Increment and display page views using a tiny Go server with Redis (**Upstash** recommended) and deploy on **Vercel**.

## Why nums?

Most analytics tools are heavy and track more than you need. nums focuses on being:
- **Simple** – one API call increments or fetches a count
- **Fast** – backed by Redis for low-latency reads and writes
- **Lightweight** – no scripts or tracking pixels
- **Privacy-friendly** – no personal data collection, deployed on your infrastructure
- **Flexible** – counts can be displayed as JSON, text, or dynamic badges

## Features
- Track hits for any page or resource
- Auto-create counters on first use
- Return counts as plain text or JSON
- Generate SVG badges you can embed in READMEs, docs, or sites
- Easy deployment with Vercel + Upstash Redis
- Open-source and self-hostable

## Example use cases
- Page view counters for websites
- Download counters for projects or assets
- Visit counters for documentation pages
- Badges for GitHub READMEs
