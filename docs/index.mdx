nums is an open-source hit counter and badge service. Increment and display page views using a tiny Go server with Redis (Upstash recommended) and deploy on Vercel.

## Why nums?

- Simple — one API call increments or fetches a count
- Fast — Redis-backed for low-latency reads and writes
- Lightweight — no scripts or tracking pixels
- Privacy-friendly — no personal data collection
- Flexible — JSON, text, and dynamic badges

## Features

- Track hits for any page or resource
- Auto-create counters on first use
- Return counts as plain text or JSON
- Generate SVG badges for READMEs, docs, or sites
- Easy deployment with Vercel + Upstash Redis
- Open-source and self-hostable

## Example use cases

- Page view counters for websites
- Download counters for projects or assets
- Visit counters for documentation pages
- Badges for GitHub READMEs
